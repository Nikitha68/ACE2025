        <h2>Welcome to Smart Cities</h2>
        <p>Here comes our most awaited and aspicious smart city project plans to you guys!! </p>
        <p>A Smart City provides core infrastructure and gives a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of ‘Smart’ Solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model which will act like a light house to other aspiring cities.

            The core infrastructure elements in a Smart City would include:<br>
            1. Adequate water supply<br>
            2. Assured electricity supply<br>
            3. Sanitation, including solid waste management<br>
            4. Efficient urban mobility and public transport<br>
            5. Affordable housing, especially for the poor<br>
            6. Robust IT connectivity and digitalization<br>
            7. Good governance, especially e-governance and citizen participation<br>
            8. Sustainable environment<br>
            9. Safety and security of citizens, particularly women, children and the elderly<br>
            10. Health and education<br>
